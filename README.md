# MetroloJA

A guide for time-tracking metrology analyses of light microscopes, after using the ImageJ MetroloJ_QC plugin. :tada:

MetroloJ_QC is a plugin whose goal is to enable automation of quality control tests regularly implemented within a light microscopy facility. This plugin used from the image analysis software, **ImageJ**, was developed by Fabrice CordeliÃ¨res and Cedrick Matthews ([GitHub Pages](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/MetroloJ_QC)). After running MetroloJ_QC, an output folder is created, named **Processed**. 

MetroloJA is a Jupyter notebook that allows a follow-up over time of these quality control tests of light microscopes of a facility by proceeding as follows: 
> - [x] Extract analysis data from the Processed folder
> - [x] Represent this data as a boxplot with statistical tests
