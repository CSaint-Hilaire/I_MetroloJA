A guide for time-tracking metrology analyses of light microscopes, after using the ImageJ MetroloJ_QC plugin. :tada:

## MetroloJ_QC plugin
MetroloJ_QC is a plugin whose goal is to enable automation of quality control tests regularly implemented within a light microscopy facility. This plugin, used from the image analysis software **ImageJ**, was developed by Fabrice Cordelières and Cedrick Matthews ([GitHub Pages](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/MetroloJ_QC)). After running MetroloJ_QC, an output folder is created, named **Processed**. &#x1F4D7; 

## MetroloJA description
MetroloJA is a Jupyter notebook that allows a follow-up over time of these quality control tests of light microscopes of a facility by proceeding as follows: 
 > - [x] Extract analysis data from the **Processed** folder :+1:
 > - [x] Represent this data as a **boxplot** with statistical tests, for follow-up over time with dates :tada:

## Getting Started
### Installation
The only thing to do is to click on this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CSaint-Hilaire/MetroloJA/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fmetroloj_analyze.ipynb). 
The notebook opens in an executable environment from [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and it is converted into a standalone application using [Voilà](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html). The process can take few minutes, be patient ! :laughing:

### Usage
